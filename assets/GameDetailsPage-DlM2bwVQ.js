A prequel, S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Clear Sky, was announced by GSC Gameworld in 2007 and released to mixed reviews. The game is a non-linear, <a href="/open-world/3015-207/" data-ref-id="3015-207">open world </a>shooter, which falls heavily on the <a href="/first-person-perspective/3015-330/" data-ref-id="3015-330">FPS </a>side of the FPS RPG genre. It features large open maps, populated by mutants, friendly and enemy NPC characters. There are also several underground maps such as the X10-X18 series of experimental laboratories.</p><p>The year is 2012; 6 years after the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant suffered a mysterious second meltdown, leaving the 25km radius area known as the Exclusion Zone a barren wasteland filled with mutants, strange inexplicable anomalies and artifacts with strange properties. In S.T.A.L.K.E.R, players control a "stalker", a scavenger searching the Zone for valuable artifacts.</p><p>In the game, the player must deal with radiation hazards, areas distorted by the explosion and unexplainable by science known as anomalies, as well as enemy stalkers such as bandits or Army soldiers. The game features the "A-Life" AI system, in which NPCs will roam the world and perform their own unscripted activities. The game features a main set of storyline missions, as well as many optional tasks that can be performed for rewards (typically assassination or object retrieval missions). The game features a faction system, where the player has different standings (enemy, neutral, friend) to individual faction members and to the faction as a whole. The player may choose to aid different factions, such as Duty or Freedom, in return for different rewards and possible repercussions or to stay neutral.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9278/376142-stalker1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-376142" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75111111111111" data-width="450" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 450px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.1%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9278/376142-stalker1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-376142"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/9278/376142-stalker1.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9278/376142-stalker1.jpg 450w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/9278/376142-stalker1.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></a></figure><p>The game does not play like a normal RPG, where the player may customize their own attributes, but the game does allow the player to equip a wide variety of artifacts which may change the player's vulnerability to various types of damage as well as change their physical attributes while in use. Character interaction is generally limited to a friend-or-foe relationship system with almost no dialogue for generic NPCs. The game features a bare-bones shadow-based stealth system in addition to normal shooter mechanics. The story is told through rendered <a href="/cutscene/3015-22/" data-ref-id="3015-22">cutscenes </a>between major story segments.</p><p>The game is infamous for its instability and many bugs (such as the "irradiation" bug, where a player enters a level changer while under the effects of radiation become constantly irradiated even if outside of a radiation hotspot). The developers released five patches, the latest of which (1.006) was recalled due to further bugs caused. Most of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. mod community develops mods for patch 1.0004 and 1.0005, the most commonly used patches. In the meantime, a community patch known as the <a href="http://metacognix.com/stlkrsoc/index.html" rel="nofollow ">Zone Reclamation Project </a>compiled by Natvac has fixed many of the bugs remaining in the game.</p><h2>Development and Alpha Build</h2><p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was initially announced in November 2001, and was set to be released in late 2003. The game was previously known as S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Oblivion Lost. Vehicles were initially a part of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but were scrapped from the final version of the game. In addition, the "burer" and "chimera" mutants were removed from the final game, as well as several maps, such as "darkscape" and the original Limansk map (the original storyline had the player rescuing Strelok's associate Doc from the grasp of mercenaries in Limansk) - all features which the "<a href="http://priboi-story.extra.hu/engine/" rel="nofollow ">Lost Alpha</a>" mod will attempt to add back to the game.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1094312" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1094312"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a></figure><p>However, it was delayed several times. The game was finally released world wide on March 22, 2007. The game offers both single player and multiplayer, though the latter is the weaker of the two. The game has since been released on Steam and developed a large cult fanbase, which continues to add in old removed content and to modify the game.</p><p>In March 2009, GSC Gameworld released the Oct. 18 2004 alpha build of the then S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Oblivion Lost (NOT to be confused with Kanyahlos's Oblivion Lost mod). It includes features cut from the final game, such a stronger sci-fi element as well as driveable vehicles. The game world was larger, with less barbed wire fences reducing level size. GSC Game World stated that they wouldn't provide technical support or guarantee stability for the alpha build. It is, despite the instability, worth downloading and having a look at for any S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fan, just to see how much changed.

The second explosion has contaminated the surrounding areas with radiation, causing hideous mutations in the wildlife.</p><p>The radiations has also resulted in mutations among animals, making them a whole lot different and a lot more violent compared to their real world counterparts. There also exists quite a few mutated humans, especially in the underground tunnels, which makes the environment a lot more creepy.</p><h2>RPG Elements</h2><p>A large part of the game deals with the management of the player character and thus effectiveness in The Zone. The character management is split up into two sections: items and character information. The character inventory within the game is made up of various elements of player management. The grid boxes are meant for items and all other areas are for descriptions and other information. The other side of the RPG coin here is the economy of The Zone and the player's state within the mercantile system.</p><h3>Items</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4866/1023631-stalker_20070526_055517.png" data-ref-id="1300-1023631" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1024px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4866/1023631-stalker_20070526_055517.png" data-ref-id="1300-1023631"><img alt="In-game inventory.

Each item has a certain weight and, of course, the inventory can only hold a certain amount of weight. The size of each items also means that there is a limit to the amount of items that can be contained within the inventory. The bulk of the inventory will deal with weaponry. The hyper-realistic aspect of the game's gun play means there's a cornucopia of real-world ammo to use. This coincides with the real-world use of Russian and international fire-arms with slightly modified in-game versions of the real weapons. Each weapon can have multiple firing modes, and attachments like scopes and silencers. Strangely enough, silencers are very rare in the game. The game will allow players to equip armor, a primary weapon, a secondary weapon and artifacts.</p><h3>Artifacts</h3><p>The "abilities" in the game can be enhanced by attaching artifacts to the belt. The artifacts can range from common junk to very rare and each have their own cost vs. reward in their use. Players can fit up to five artifacts. The fact that they are a pricy commodity in The Zone doesn't hurt either, except for the radiation.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Artifact</th><th>Positive Effects</th><th>Negative

Clicking on an item will provide players with information regarding its uses, stat bonuses it provides, the cost, weight, and a little background info.</p><h3>Economy</h3><p>There are a small number of merchants within the game; they buy everything and sell what they can get. Their inventory items depend how deep they are in The Zone. Money is important in stocking up on items, ammo, and anything else that is needed.</p><h3>PDA</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1023965" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.80078125" data-width="768" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 768px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.1%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1023965"><img alt="The PDA." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg 768w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="The PDA." src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg 768w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>The PDA.</figcaption></figure><p>Another element to consider is the PDA. It features all primary and secondary objectives, the journal, statistics, and the map of The Zone. It's a major source of narrative as it can display tapes and documents that provide an insight into the world. There is also an aspect of competition amongst STALKER as each notable one is given a rank and compete to become the top dog. Admittedly the statistic feature relating to the STALKER is nebulous and hard to discern what defines which value. It does however give statistics such as mutants killed and time played.</p><h2>Quests and Factions</h2><p>The story-driven quest will be provided by the merchants and if players have fulfilled all previous engagements, a prompt will appear directing players to a particular merchant. The 100 Rad Bar will be a hotspot of STALKERS and other characters ready to give players a job to do; this will be the primary way of obtaining cash and seeing the game world.</p><h3>Factions</h3><p>Faction interaction is an integral part of Shadow of Chernobyl. Factions in the game consist of the Loners, Bandits, Military, Freedom, Duty, Ecologists, Mercenaries and the Monolith. Players can choose between aiding different groups, such as Freedom or Duty, while others begin as enemies (in the case of bandits and military). Factions are also mentioned in the game which are not represented in the game, such as Final Day and The Confederacy. Joining a faction will gain the player acceptance, entrance into their home bases and allows players to purchase from their traders and take quests from the faction leaders. It is possible to be hostile to all factions. The protagonist's relationship with individual STALKERs depend on the player's actions; enemy factions may have members who are neutral towards the protagonist (if players were friendly with them before becoming hostile to the faction) and neutral factions can have members who are hostile (notably, some groups of loners may be hostile).</p><h4>Loners</h4><p>Loners are the general stalker population. They are those who are unaligned with other groups. They may vary from green rookies sitting in the rookie village to hardened veterans with assault rifles and exoskeletons. If players have a bad reputation, the loner population may turn hostile. Bandits are the opposite numbers of loners, groups of stalkers who roam the Zone killing and looting, attempting to steal from the factions and lone stalkers alike. They are hostile and vary from thugs with sawed-off shotguns to hardened well-organized gangs armed with MP5s. Bandits can become neutral if the protagonist is enemies with Duty, Freedom, and Loners and have a terrible reputation.</p><h4>Military</h4><p>The Military's goal is to rid the Zone of stalkers. They are always enemies. Military consists of regular soldiers, who are generally used to patrol and occupy their bases. These are unused to the Zone and are normally armed with AK-74Us. More elite Spetsnaz are employed for raids and special operations deep into the Zone. These are armed with better quality AN-94 Abakans. The Military also hires veteran stalkers in return for amnesty; Military stalkers may be encountered by the player in the late game and are dangerous enemies. The Ecologists - the scientists - are interested in the new possibilities in science revealed by the Zone; unfortunately they work in an extremely hostile environment filled with enemies (such as the Mercenary faction who work to steal their valuable research, as well as zombies and other mutants who menace them). They are unskilled fighters and generally need the help of the Military (in the form of helicopters), Duty soldiers (who later defend their lab from zombie attacks) and the protagonist. Mercenaries are mysterious soldiers-for-hire wandering the Zone, fulfilling objectives for foreign hire. They are the most mysterious faction, mostly because their agenda is unknown. They are equipped with advanced NATO equipment. A group of mercenaries have been engaged in attempting to infiltrate Freedom.</p><h4>Duty</h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1023957" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="800" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 800px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1023957"><img alt="A group of Duty members." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="A group of Duty members." src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>A group of Duty members.</figcaption></figure><p>Duty was formed out the remnants of the military forces that first ventured into the Zone, the survivors swearing to destroy The Zone and rid the world of its evil. They are closely allied to the Ecologists (to whom they give artifacts for research) and provide shelter for groups of loners in the Rostok area around the 100 Rads Bar. They are primarily involved in suppressing bandits and mercenaries, as well as exterminating mutants. They are armed with Warsaw Pact weaponry, such as the AN-94 Abakan and the AK-74. Veteran Duty soldiers may be armed with superior AS Val or OTs-14 Grozas, which outmatch Freedom's weaponry. Duty has a militaristic command structure and are led by General Voronin. A group of interest is Skull's deserters, a group of veteran Duty fighters who have ignored the ceasefire and are planning to attack the Freedom base.</p><h4>Freedom</h4><p>Freedom believe that the Zone belongs to everyone and shouldn't be closed by the Government. They have taken over the Army Warehouses north of Rostok and are involved in an uneasy ceasefire with Duty forces. Freedom are slightly antagonistic towards Ecologists - seeing them as representatives of the Ukrainian Government - but are neutral to the bandits, preferring a live-and-let-live policy. Freedom are better armed than Duty, with Bulldog RG-6 grenade launchers and SVD sniper rifles as well as NATO weaponry. Freedom have a looser command structure than Duty, and are led by Lukash and his deputy Max.</p><h4>Monolith</h4><p>The Monolith control the Red Forest, Pripyat and the Nuclear Power Plant itself. Amazingly, they haven't been rendered zombified by the power of X10, the Brain Scorcher. The Monolith are the most dangerous human enemies in the game, they are heavily armoured in exoskeletons, are armed with G36 and SVD rifles as well as the experimental Gauss rifles. They worship the Monolith, an artifact allegedly able to grant all wishes in a room in the Nuclear Power Plant.

However, the city of Pripyat was placed immediately to the south-east, which is not accurate. In reality it sits several kilometres to the north-west. Just below Pripyat in the game is the Red Forest, an area which absorbed much of the disaster’s radiation. Fortunately for the residents of northern Ukraine, the forest is nowhere near the Pripyat River, or any other major body of water. Instead, it is roughly 2 km to the south-west of the nuclear reactor, putting it over 5 km from the river itself. The upshot of these changes is that the city of Pripyat has been moved in between the power plant and the Red Forest, while all 3 landmarks have been made to form a straight line which has no relationship to reality.</p><h3>List of Locations</h3><ul><li><b>Cordon</b></li><li><b>Garbage</b></li><li><b>Agroprom</b><ul><li>Agroprom Underground</li></ul></li><li><b>Dark Valley</b><ul><li>Lab X-18</li></ul></li><li><b>Rostok</b><ul><li>Bar</li><li>Wild Territory</li></ul></li><li><b>Yantar</b><ul><li>Lab X-16</li></ul></li><li><b>Army Warehouses</b></li><li><b>Red Forest</b><ul><li>Lab X-10</li></ul></li><li><b>Pripyat</b></li><li><b>Chernobyl Power Plant</b><ul><li>Sarcophagus</li><li>Monolith Control Center</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Dangers of The Zone</h2><p>Resulting from the fictional second Chernobyl Outpost Disaster, Radiation and altered physics have engulfed The Zone, turning it into a hostile and dangerous place.</p><h3>Anomalies</h3><p>Anomalies are spots where standard physics have been defied, producing a variety of traps, some more deadly than others. Several varieties exist, from mild electric shocks to near invisible tornado-like whirlwinds and Burning Anomalies. If players maintain a keen eye while playing, they will notice air or light distortions that will give their locations away. Anomalies also produce Artifacts and different Anomalies denote a differing possible Artifact. Anomalies always change location after a Blowout.</p><h4>List of Anomalies<b>:</b></h4><ul><li>Burner</li><li>Vortex</li><li>Springboard</li><li>Whirligig</li><li>Fruit Punch</li><li>Electro</li><li>Burnt Fuzz</li><li>Gas</li><li>Lift</li><li>Time</li><li>Sparks</li><li>Space Anomaly</li></ul><h3>Radiation</h3><p>The Chernobyl outskirts have suffered from radiation since the initial disaster took place in 1986. However, these were never as deadly as those produced by the second reactor explosion in 2012. Invisible pockets create invisible dead ends and mazes in unexpected places. Like Anomalies, they can change quickly after a Blowout, so pay attention to the Radiometer and don't sprint through unexplored areas. The lasting effects of Radiation can be devastating and should be eliminated with Anti-Rad medicine.</p><h3>Mutants</h3><p>As a result of increased radiation, both humans and animals have succumbed to un-evolutionary mutation, effectively increasing the aggression of those affected. Rarely is there a nice mutant in the world and unfortunately bullets are the solution. Several mutated creatures are within the game, however removed from the final product. These are available through user modifications, such as Oblivion Lost or AMK.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Description</th><th>Mutant</th></tr><tr><td>Heavily mutated humans, thought to be missing military stalkers, that have been engulfed by the zone.

Complete 2009</h2><p>The STALKER Complete 2009 mod was designed by professional graphic artists and has set the standards for making STALKER mods. Its grand success has inspired many similar project, but the Complete 2009 is one of the most talked-about and famous mods out there – for any game, really. The mod has even been reviewed by magazines such as PCFormat among others.</p><p>One of the key designers working on the Complete 2009, Pavel Dolgov (ArtisPavel), and the rest of the Complete crew spent nearly two years designing the mod. They have renewed the game with updated visual qualities</p><p><i>(over 900 textures have been redone)</i></p><p>as well as modified some of the gameplay to make it more fit for people which otherwise might not have originally been into STALKER. The team working on the mod has made sure not to screw around with the core elements of the game; the overall experience will stay the same, albeit enhanced by beautiful graphics fit for a newer generation. Simply put, the whole presentation of the game has been improved so a wider range of audience might be able to enjoy this game as much as hardcore STALKER fans.</p><p>The designers have retouched almost every single little detail, and overall the game feels more polished. According to the designers, this mod is especially ideal for players who already have completed the game but want to do a replay.</p><p><i>Full list of features and enhancements: </i></p><h3>Weather</h3><ul><li>Natural multi-phase day and night transitions, based on daily observations, photographs, and studies by artists from Dolgov Studios</li><li>Vast distant views, creating large open world around the player</li><li>New multi-phase moon design authored by Dolgov Studios.</li><li>Proper sun travel according to date (01.05.2012) and geographic location (Ukraine).</li><li>Enhanced High Dynamic Range lighting and Sun effects (including realistic sunsets and sunrises).</li><li>Increased weather cycling.</li><li>Different types of storms, fast and slow. # Wet surfaces during rain.</li><li>High resolution nighttime constellation map. # Improved water animations.</li></ul><h3>Graphics</h3><ul><li>Parallax Occlusion Mapping - Gives 2D textures the illusion of 3D geometry, most visible on surfaces such as brick walls.</li><li>Screen Space Ambient Occlusion - A shading method that approximates the way light radiates in real life, creating soft shadows in corner-type places with a difficult lighting sample.</li><li>Depth of Field - An effect that creates a gradual decrease in sharpness determined by the subject distance. For example, a distant landscape will appear blurry when compared to closer objects.</li><li>Motion Blur - A streaking effect frequently used to show a sense of speed when the camera quickly moves around.</li><li>Particle system - Enhanced rendering of fire, explosions, smoke, muzzle, sparks, falling leaves, anomalies, fog, and more.</li><li>Water Shaders - Improved water effects ported from S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky.</li><li>Fire Dynamic Lighting - Fire now illuminates the surroundings, casting dynamic shadows.</li></ul><h3>Textures</h3><ul><li>Locations - all textures replaced with higher quality photographs with partial use of original files, creating highly detailed outdoor and indoor environments.</li><li>Living Creatures - Mutated creatures have soaking wet flesh showing through wounds, creating a disturbingly graphic effect. Also, all humans in Zone have been retouched down to even the finest details (armor, shoes, wrinkles, faces, even their eyeballs).</li><li>Vehicles - 20 year old vehicles in the Zone now appear realistically rusted and abandoned.</li></ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><p>The game is know for its rather massive arsenal of bugs. But with the Complete 09, the bugs disappear. The community have gathered an extensive number of bugs which the developers have picked up on and which have been eliminated with the Complete mod.</p><h3>A.I.</h3><ul><li><strong>New abilities</strong> - NPCs can avoid anomalies, remove dead bodies from camp sites, throw grenades, change armor, and even heal other NPCs. Players can also give weapons and armor to NPCs by selling or dropping it near them and giving them privacy to equip them (An NPC’s preferences may prevent them from accepting the items, however).</li><li><strong>Early detection</strong> - Removed the ability for NPCs to notice the player at unrealistically large distances.</li><li><strong>Stealth</strong> - Knife and other critical sounds such as falling dead bodies, grass, and footsteps have been properly commented to reduce their sound radius, making the gameplay much more realistic.</li><li><strong>Death panic</strong> - Reduced the sound distance of death cries (in the original game it caused the entire camp to alert once one member was hit, as it was set to be heard at a great distance).</li></ul><h3>Sound</h3><p>Complete 2009 replaces a massive amount of in-game sounds, including weapons, anomalies, equipment clatter, footsteps, nightlife, bullet fly-by sounds and more with higher quality versions. Also, the mod adds unique ambient sounds for each weather cycle. “Repetitive” NPCs will now only say their lines once (such as the “Get out of here, stalker” line), and hundreds of additional ambient sounds like bar kitchen cooking, nighttime horror sounds, fog sounds, and more have been added to the game, creating a more immersive audio experience.</p><h3>Other</h3><p>There is a bunch of other changes and enhancements as well -- localization, a new interface, additional music like guitar tracks played by stalkers around in the game as well as features as a sleeping bag, which allows the player to speed up time. It has also been added freeplay, which means when the game is completed with the "good" ending, the player can continue to roam the mysteries zone.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1616678" data-size="small" data-ratio="1" data-width="800" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 800px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1616678"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-width="640" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg 640w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-width="640"></noscript></a></figure><p>The <a href="/original-soundtrack/3015-189/" data-ref-id="3015-189">original score </a>for S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl was composed by MoozE with the exception of the last 3 tracks, done by FireLake.
