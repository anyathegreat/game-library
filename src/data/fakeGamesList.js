A prequel, S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Clear Sky, was announced by GSC Gameworld in 2007 and released to mixed reviews. The game is a non-linear, <a href="/open-world/3015-207/" data-ref-id="3015-207">open world </a>shooter, which falls heavily on the <a href="/first-person-perspective/3015-330/" data-ref-id="3015-330">FPS </a>side of the FPS RPG genre. It features large open maps, populated by mutants, friendly and enemy NPC characters. There are also several underground maps such as the X10-X18 series of experimental laboratories.</p><p>The year is 2012; 6 years after the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant suffered a mysterious second meltdown, leaving the 25km radius area known as the Exclusion Zone a barren wasteland filled with mutants, strange inexplicable anomalies and artifacts with strange properties. In S.T.A.L.K.E.R, players control a "stalker", a scavenger searching the Zone for valuable artifacts.</p><p>In the game, the player must deal with radiation hazards, areas distorted by the explosion and unexplainable by science known as anomalies, as well as enemy stalkers such as bandits or Army soldiers. The game features the "A-Life" AI system, in which NPCs will roam the world and perform their own unscripted activities. The game features a main set of storyline missions, as well as many optional tasks that can be performed for rewards (typically assassination or object retrieval missions). The game features a faction system, where the player has different standings (enemy, neutral, friend) to individual faction members and to the faction as a whole. The player may choose to aid different factions, such as Duty or Freedom, in return for different rewards and possible repercussions or to stay neutral.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9278/376142-stalker1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-376142" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75111111111111" data-width="450" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 450px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.1%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9278/376142-stalker1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-376142"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/9278/376142-stalker1.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/9278/376142-stalker1.jpg 450w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/9278/376142-stalker1.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></a></figure><p>The game does not play like a normal RPG, where the player may customize their own attributes, but the game does allow the player to equip a wide variety of artifacts which may change the player\'s vulnerability to various types of damage as well as change their physical attributes while in use. Character interaction is generally limited to a friend-or-foe relationship system with almost no dialogue for generic NPCs. The game features a bare-bones shadow-based stealth system in addition to normal shooter mechanics. The story is told through rendered <a href="/cutscene/3015-22/" data-ref-id="3015-22">cutscenes </a>between major story segments.</p><p>The game is infamous for its instability and many bugs (such as the "irradiation" bug, where a player enters a level changer while under the effects of radiation become constantly irradiated even if outside of a radiation hotspot). The developers released five patches, the latest of which (1.006) was recalled due to further bugs caused. Most of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. mod community develops mods for patch 1.0004 and 1.0005, the most commonly used patches. In the meantime, a community patch known as the <a href="http://metacognix.com/stlkrsoc/index.html" rel="nofollow ">Zone Reclamation Project </a>compiled by Natvac has fixed many of the bugs remaining in the game.</p><h2>Development and Alpha Build</h2><p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was initially announced in November 2001, and was set to be released in late 2003. The game was previously known as S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Oblivion Lost. Vehicles were initially a part of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but were scrapped from the final version of the game. In addition, the "burer" and "chimera" mutants were removed from the final game, as well as several maps, such as "darkscape" and the original Limansk map (the original storyline had the player rescuing Strelok\'s associate Doc from the grasp of mercenaries in Limansk) - all features which the "<a href="http://priboi-story.extra.hu/engine/" rel="nofollow ">Lost Alpha</a>" mod will attempt to add back to the game.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1094312" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1094312"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/23808/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a></figure><p>However, it was delayed several times. The game was finally released world wide on March 22, 2007. The game offers both single player and multiplayer, though the latter is the weaker of the two. The game has since been released on Steam and developed a large cult fanbase, which continues to add in old removed content and to modify the game.</p><p>In March 2009, GSC Gameworld released the Oct. 18 2004 alpha build of the then S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Oblivion Lost (NOT to be confused with Kanyahlos\'s Oblivion Lost mod). It includes features cut from the final game, such a stronger sci-fi element as well as driveable vehicles. The game world was larger, with less barbed wire fences reducing level size. GSC Game World stated that they wouldn\'t provide technical support or guarantee stability for the alpha build. It is, despite the instability, worth downloading and having a look at for any S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fan, just to see how much changed.

The second explosion has contaminated the surrounding areas with radiation, causing hideous mutations in the wildlife.</p><p>The radiations has also resulted in mutations among animals, making them a whole lot different and a lot more violent compared to their real world counterparts. There also exists quite a few mutated humans, especially in the underground tunnels, which makes the environment a lot more creepy.</p><h2>RPG Elements</h2><p>A large part of the game deals with the management of the player character and thus effectiveness in The Zone. The character management is split up into two sections: items and character information. The character inventory within the game is made up of various elements of player management. The grid boxes are meant for items and all other areas are for descriptions and other information. The other side of the RPG coin here is the economy of The Zone and the player\'s state within the mercantile system.</p><h3>Items</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4866/1023631-stalker_20070526_055517.png" data-ref-id="1300-1023631" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1024px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4866/1023631-stalker_20070526_055517.png" data-ref-id="1300-1023631"><img alt="In-game inventory.

Also, stats not representative.</figcaption></figure><p>The game is riddled with items of many kinds including food, drink, guns, <a href="/ammo/3055-533/" data-ref-id="3055-533">ammo</a>, weapons,<a href="/first-aid-kit/3055-1285/" data-ref-id="3055-1285">med kits</a>, armor, and other kinds of items. Each item has a certain weight and, of course, the inventory can only hold a certain amount of weight. The size of each items also means that there is a limit to the amount of items that can be contained within the inventory. The bulk of the inventory will deal with weaponry. The hyper-realistic aspect of the game\'s gun play means there\'s a cornucopia of real-world ammo to use. This coincides with the real-world use of Russian and international fire-arms with slightly modified in-game versions of the real weapons. Each weapon can have multiple firing modes, and attachments like scopes and silencers. Strangely enough, silencers are very rare in the game. The game will allow players to equip armor, a primary weapon, a secondary weapon and artifacts.</p><h3>Artifacts</h3><p>The "abilities" in the game can be enhanced by attaching artifacts to the belt. The artifacts can range from common junk to very rare and each have their own cost vs. reward in their use. Players can fit up to five artifacts. The fact that they are a pricy commodity in The Zone doesn\'t hurt either, except for the radiation.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Artifact</th><th>Positive Effects</th><th>Negative

Clicking on an item will provide players with information regarding its uses, stat bonuses it provides, the cost, weight, and a little background info.</p><h3>Economy</h3><p>There are a small number of merchants within the game; they buy everything and sell what they can get. Their inventory items depend how deep they are in The Zone. Money is important in stocking up on items, ammo, and anything else that is needed.</p><h3>PDA</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1023965" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.80078125" data-width="768" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 768px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:80.1%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1023965"><img alt="The PDA." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg 768w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="The PDA." src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg 768w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>The PDA.</figcaption></figure><p>Another element to consider is the PDA. It features all primary and secondary objectives, the journal, statistics, and the map of The Zone. It\'s a major source of narrative as it can display tapes and documents that provide an insight into the world. There is also an aspect of competition amongst STALKER as each notable one is given a rank and compete to become the top dog. Admittedly the statistic feature relating to the STALKER is nebulous and hard to discern what defines which value. It does however give statistics such as mutants killed and time played.</p><h2>Quests and Factions</h2><p>The story-driven quest will be provided by the merchants and if players have fulfilled all previous engagements, a prompt will appear directing players to a particular merchant. The 100 Rad Bar will be a hotspot of STALKERS and other characters ready to give players a job to do; this will be the primary way of obtaining cash and seeing the game world.</p><h3>Factions</h3><p>Faction interaction is an integral part of Shadow of Chernobyl. Factions in the game consist of the Loners, Bandits, Military, Freedom, Duty, Ecologists, Mercenaries and the Monolith. Players can choose between aiding different groups, such as Freedom or Duty, while others begin as enemies (in the case of bandits and military). Factions are also mentioned in the game which are not represented in the game, such as Final Day and The Confederacy. Joining a faction will gain the player acceptance, entrance into their home bases and allows players to purchase from their traders and take quests from the faction leaders. It is possible to be hostile to all factions. The protagonist\'s relationship with individual STALKERs depend on the player\'s actions; enemy factions may have members who are neutral towards the protagonist (if players were friendly with them before becoming hostile to the faction) and neutral factions can have members who are hostile (notably, some groups of loners may be hostile).</p><h4>Loners</h4><p>Loners are the general stalker population. They are those who are unaligned with other groups. They may vary from green rookies sitting in the rookie village to hardened veterans with assault rifles and exoskeletons. If players have a bad reputation, the loner population may turn hostile. Bandits are the opposite numbers of loners, groups of stalkers who roam the Zone killing and looting, attempting to steal from the factions and lone stalkers alike. They are hostile and vary from thugs with sawed-off shotguns to hardened well-organized gangs armed with MP5s. Bandits can become neutral if the protagonist is enemies with Duty, Freedom, and Loners and have a terrible reputation.</p><h4>Military</h4><p>The Military\'s goal is to rid the Zone of stalkers. They are always enemies. Military consists of regular soldiers, who are generally used to patrol and occupy their bases. These are unused to the Zone and are normally armed with AK-74Us. More elite Spetsnaz are employed for raids and special operations deep into the Zone. These are armed with better quality AN-94 Abakans. The Military also hires veteran stalkers in return for amnesty; Military stalkers may be encountered by the player in the late game and are dangerous enemies. The Ecologists - the scientists - are interested in the new possibilities in science revealed by the Zone; unfortunately they work in an extremely hostile environment filled with enemies (such as the Mercenary faction who work to steal their valuable research, as well as zombies and other mutants who menace them). They are unskilled fighters and generally need the help of the Military (in the form of helicopters), Duty soldiers (who later defend their lab from zombie attacks) and the protagonist. Mercenaries are mysterious soldiers-for-hire wandering the Zone, fulfilling objectives for foreign hire. They are the most mysterious faction, mostly because their agenda is unknown. They are equipped with advanced NATO equipment. A group of mercenaries have been engaged in attempting to infiltrate Freedom.</p><h4>Duty</h4><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1023957" data-size="small" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="800" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 800px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:75.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1023957"><img alt="A group of Duty members." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="A group of Duty members." src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4866/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>A group of Duty members.</figcaption></figure><p>Duty was formed out the remnants of the military forces that first ventured into the Zone, the survivors swearing to destroy The Zone and rid the world of its evil. They are closely allied to the Ecologists (to whom they give artifacts for research) and provide shelter for groups of loners in the Rostok area around the 100 Rads Bar. They are primarily involved in suppressing bandits and mercenaries, as well as exterminating mutants. They are armed with Warsaw Pact weaponry, such as the AN-94 Abakan and the AK-74. Veteran Duty soldiers may be armed with superior AS Val or OTs-14 Grozas, which outmatch Freedom\'s weaponry. Duty has a militaristic command structure and are led by General Voronin. A group of interest is Skull\'s deserters, a group of veteran Duty fighters who have ignored the ceasefire and are planning to attack the Freedom base.</p><h4>Freedom</h4><p>Freedom believe that the Zone belongs to everyone and shouldn\'t be closed by the Government. They have taken over the Army Warehouses north of Rostok and are involved in an uneasy ceasefire with Duty forces. Freedom are slightly antagonistic towards Ecologists - seeing them as representatives of the Ukrainian Government - but are neutral to the bandits, preferring a live-and-let-live policy. Freedom are better armed than Duty, with Bulldog RG-6 grenade launchers and SVD sniper rifles as well as NATO weaponry. Freedom have a looser command structure than Duty, and are led by Lukash and his deputy Max.</p><h4>Monolith</h4><p>The Monolith control the Red Forest, Pripyat and the Nuclear Power Plant itself. Amazingly, they haven\'t been rendered zombified by the power of X10, the Brain Scorcher. The Monolith are the most dangerous human enemies in the game, they are heavily armoured in exoskeletons, are armed with G36 and SVD rifles as well as the experimental Gauss rifles. They worship the Monolith, an artifact allegedly able to grant all wishes in a room in the Nuclear Power Plant.

However, the city of Pripyat was placed immediately to the south-east, which is not accurate. In reality it sits several kilometres to the north-west. Just below Pripyat in the game is the Red Forest, an area which absorbed much of the disaster\u2019s radiation. Fortunately for the residents of northern Ukraine, the forest is nowhere near the Pripyat River, or any other major body of water. Instead, it is roughly 2 km to the south-west of the nuclear reactor, putting it over 5 km from the river itself. The upshot of these changes is that the city of Pripyat has been moved in between the power plant and the Red Forest, while all 3 landmarks have been made to form a straight line which has no relationship to reality.</p><h3>List of Locations</h3><ul><li><b>Cordon</b></li><li><b>Garbage</b></li><li><b>Agroprom</b><ul><li>Agroprom Underground</li></ul></li><li><b>Dark Valley</b><ul><li>Lab X-18</li></ul></li><li><b>Rostok</b><ul><li>Bar</li><li>Wild Territory</li></ul></li><li><b>Yantar</b><ul><li>Lab X-16</li></ul></li><li><b>Army Warehouses</b></li><li><b>Red Forest</b><ul><li>Lab X-10</li></ul></li><li><b>Pripyat</b></li><li><b>Chernobyl Power Plant</b><ul><li>Sarcophagus</li><li>Monolith Control Center</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Dangers of The Zone</h2><p>Resulting from the fictional second Chernobyl Outpost Disaster, Radiation and altered physics have engulfed The Zone, turning it into a hostile and dangerous place.</p><h3>Anomalies</h3><p>Anomalies are spots where standard physics have been defied, producing a variety of traps, some more deadly than others. Several varieties exist, from mild electric shocks to near invisible tornado-like whirlwinds and Burning Anomalies. If players maintain a keen eye while playing, they will notice air or light distortions that will give their locations away. Anomalies also produce Artifacts and different Anomalies denote a differing possible Artifact. Anomalies always change location after a Blowout.</p><h4>List of Anomalies<b>:</b></h4><ul><li>Burner</li><li>Vortex</li><li>Springboard</li><li>Whirligig</li><li>Fruit Punch</li><li>Electro</li><li>Burnt Fuzz</li><li>Gas</li><li>Lift</li><li>Time</li><li>Sparks</li><li>Space Anomaly</li></ul><h3>Radiation</h3><p>The Chernobyl outskirts have suffered from radiation since the initial disaster took place in 1986. However, these were never as deadly as those produced by the second reactor explosion in 2012. Invisible pockets create invisible dead ends and mazes in unexpected places. Like Anomalies, they can change quickly after a Blowout, so pay attention to the Radiometer and don\'t sprint through unexplored areas. The lasting effects of Radiation can be devastating and should be eliminated with Anti-Rad medicine.</p><h3>Mutants</h3><p>As a result of increased radiation, both humans and animals have succumbed to un-evolutionary mutation, effectively increasing the aggression of those affected. Rarely is there a nice mutant in the world and unfortunately bullets are the solution. Several mutated creatures are within the game, however removed from the final product. These are available through user modifications, such as Oblivion Lost or AMK.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Description</th><th>Mutant</th></tr><tr><td>Heavily mutated humans, thought to be missing military stalkers, that have been engulfed by the zone.

Complete 2009</h2><p>The STALKER Complete 2009 mod was designed by professional graphic artists and has set the standards for making STALKER mods. Its grand success has inspired many similar project, but the Complete 2009 is one of the most talked-about and famous mods out there \u2013 for any game, really. The mod has even been reviewed by magazines such as PCFormat among others.</p><p>One of the key designers working on the Complete 2009, Pavel Dolgov (ArtisPavel), and the rest of the Complete crew spent nearly two years designing the mod. They have renewed the game with updated visual qualities</p><p><i>(over 900 textures have been redone)</i></p><p>as well as modified some of the gameplay to make it more fit for people which otherwise might not have originally been into STALKER. The team working on the mod has made sure not to screw around with the core elements of the game; the overall experience will stay the same, albeit enhanced by beautiful graphics fit for a newer generation. Simply put, the whole presentation of the game has been improved so a wider range of audience might be able to enjoy this game as much as hardcore STALKER fans.</p><p>The designers have retouched almost every single little detail, and overall the game feels more polished. According to the designers, this mod is especially ideal for players who already have completed the game but want to do a replay.</p><p><i>Full list of features and enhancements: </i></p><h3>Weather</h3><ul><li>Natural multi-phase day and night transitions, based on daily observations, photographs, and studies by artists from Dolgov Studios</li><li>Vast distant views, creating large open world around the player</li><li>New multi-phase moon design authored by Dolgov Studios.</li><li>Proper sun travel according to date (01.05.2012) and geographic location (Ukraine).</li><li>Enhanced High Dynamic Range lighting and Sun effects (including realistic sunsets and sunrises).</li><li>Increased weather cycling.</li><li>Different types of storms, fast and slow. # Wet surfaces during rain.</li><li>High resolution nighttime constellation map. # Improved water animations.</li></ul><h3>Graphics</h3><ul><li>Parallax Occlusion Mapping - Gives 2D textures the illusion of 3D geometry, most visible on surfaces such as brick walls.</li><li>Screen Space Ambient Occlusion - A shading method that approximates the way light radiates in real life, creating soft shadows in corner-type places with a difficult lighting sample.</li><li>Depth of Field - An effect that creates a gradual decrease in sharpness determined by the subject distance. For example, a distant landscape will appear blurry when compared to closer objects.</li><li>Motion Blur - A streaking effect frequently used to show a sense of speed when the camera quickly moves around.</li><li>Particle system - Enhanced rendering of fire, explosions, smoke, muzzle, sparks, falling leaves, anomalies, fog, and more.</li><li>Water Shaders - Improved water effects ported from S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky.</li><li>Fire Dynamic Lighting - Fire now illuminates the surroundings, casting dynamic shadows.</li></ul><h3>Textures</h3><ul><li>Locations - all textures replaced with higher quality photographs with partial use of original files, creating highly detailed outdoor and indoor environments.</li><li>Living Creatures - Mutated creatures have soaking wet flesh showing through wounds, creating a disturbingly graphic effect. Also, all humans in Zone have been retouched down to even the finest details (armor, shoes, wrinkles, faces, even their eyeballs).</li><li>Vehicles - 20 year old vehicles in the Zone now appear realistically rusted and abandoned.</li></ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><p>The game is know for its rather massive arsenal of bugs. But with the Complete 09, the bugs disappear. The community have gathered an extensive number of bugs which the developers have picked up on and which have been eliminated with the Complete mod.</p><h3>A.I.</h3><ul><li><strong>New abilities</strong> - NPCs can avoid anomalies, remove dead bodies from camp sites, throw grenades, change armor, and even heal other NPCs. Players can also give weapons and armor to NPCs by selling or dropping it near them and giving them privacy to equip them (An NPC\u2019s preferences may prevent them from accepting the items, however).</li><li><strong>Early detection</strong> - Removed the ability for NPCs to notice the player at unrealistically large distances.</li><li><strong>Stealth</strong> - Knife and other critical sounds such as falling dead bodies, grass, and footsteps have been properly commented to reduce their sound radius, making the gameplay much more realistic.</li><li><strong>Death panic</strong> - Reduced the sound distance of death cries (in the original game it caused the entire camp to alert once one member was hit, as it was set to be heard at a great distance).</li></ul><h3>Sound</h3><p>Complete 2009 replaces a massive amount of in-game sounds, including weapons, anomalies, equipment clatter, footsteps, nightlife, bullet fly-by sounds and more with higher quality versions. Also, the mod adds unique ambient sounds for each weather cycle. \u201cRepetitive\u201d NPCs will now only say their lines once (such as the \u201cGet out of here, stalker\u201d line), and hundreds of additional ambient sounds like bar kitchen cooking, nighttime horror sounds, fog sounds, and more have been added to the game, creating a more immersive audio experience.</p><h3>Other</h3><p>There is a bunch of other changes and enhancements as well -- localization, a new interface, additional music like guitar tracks played by stalkers around in the game as well as features as a sleeping bag, which allows the player to speed up time. It has also been added freeplay, which means when the game is completed with the "good" ending, the player can continue to roam the mysteries zone.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1616678" data-size="small" data-ratio="1" data-width="800" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 800px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1616678"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-width="640" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg 640w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg 800w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-width="640"></noscript></a></figure><p>The <a href="/original-soundtrack/3015-189/" data-ref-id="3015-189">original score </a>for S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl was composed by MoozE with the exception of the last 3 tracks, done by FireLake.

        '<h2>Overview</h2><h3>First Announcement</h3><p>On August 13th, 2010, <a href="/gsc-game-world/3010-1607/" data-ref-id="3010-1607">GSC Game World</a> announced that a full fledged sequel to <a href="/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/3030-11725/" data-ref-id="3030-11725">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. : Shadow of Chernobyl</a> was in the works and was slated to be released in 2012. Billed as "the next chapter" in the series by CEO Sergiy Grygorovych, the game was to use a new multi-platform engine built off of X-Ray, that the design team was building from the ground up. No other details were given at the time of the announcement.</p><p>On December 9th, 2011, the <a href="http://ukranews.com/ru/news/ukraine/2011/12/09/59663" rel="nofollow ">Ukrainian News Agency</a> (then UkraNews) announced that GSC Game World would be closing down. Rumors claimed the closure was because of CEO/founder Grigorovich\'s unhappiness with the development progress of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, a claim which was later refuted in a Twitter post by GSC, a post which would later be taken down. Beyond commenting on the rumor, the GSC Twitter also stated "We will do our best to continue. However, at this moment, nothing is certain." Soon after, a number of GSC employees formed <a href="/vostok-games/3010-7991/" data-ref-id="3010-7991">Vostok Games</a> and began developing <a href="/survarium/3030-38126/" data-ref-id="3030-38126">Survarium</a>.</p><h3>Second Announcement</h3><p>Following a revival in 2014, GSC Game World <a href="https://twitter.com/GSC_GW/status/996521779798605824" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted</a> on May 15th, 2018 that development of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 had been restarted, with a projected released date of 2021. This was further confirmed the following day on Sergei Grigorovich\'s Facebook page.</p><p>On July 23rd 2020, a first-look trailer for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was shown as part of the July Xbox Series X event, with the game slated to be a timed exclusive to Xbox Series X and PC, alongside being part of <a href="/xbox-game-pass/3015-9235/" data-ref-id="3015-9235">Game Pass</a> at launch. New details were added to the official website, including news that development has shifted from a proprietary engine to <a href="/unreal-engine-5/3015-9652/" data-ref-id="3015-9652">Unreal Engine 5</a>. During Microsoft\'s <a href="/e3-2021/3015-9615/" data-ref-id="3015-9615">E3 2021</a> presentation, a second trailer was shown, showcasing characters, combat, and environments from the game. The trailer included a tentative release date of April 28, 2022, and a new subtitle, "Heart of Chernobyl". On January 12, 2022, the game was delayed to a new release date of December 8, 2022.</p><p>In March of the same year, the subtitle was changed to "Heart of Chornobyl", replacing the location\'s Russian spelling with the Ukrainian spelling, a move that was assumed to be related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine begun in February 2022. As a result of the invasion, part of GSC\'s development team was <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/stalker-2-development-reportedly-continuing-in-the-czech-republic/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly</a> relocated from their <a href="/kyiv/3035-5815/" data-ref-id="3035-5815">Kyiv</a> headquarters to <a href="/prague/3035-879/" data-ref-id="3035-879">Prague</a>.</p>',

It follows Major Degtyarev and his investigation of the 5 crashed Stingray helicopters which were part of the failed Operation Fairway. The game is set shortly after the events of Shadow of Chernobyl and the shutting down of the brain scorcher. Call of Pripyat features many of the gameplay innovations that were added in Clear Sky.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1820549-degtyarov.png" data-ref-id="1300-1820549" data-size="small" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.3"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:130.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1820549-degtyarov.png" data-ref-id="1300-1820549"><img alt="Major Alexander Degtyarev" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1820549-degtyarov.png" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1820549-degtyarov.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-width="300"></a><figcaption>Major Alexander Degtyarev</figcaption></figure><p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat is a direct sequel to Shadow of Chernobyl. The events in the game are set shortly after Strelok shuts down the brain scorcher in 2012, after which a large number of Stalkers make their way to the center of the zone.</p><p>The Ukranian Army begins Operation Fairway in which several state-of-the-art Stingray helicopters were sent into the zone, to take control over Pripyat and the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The objective of the operation is to create a foothold in the region, in order to launch a full scale invasion later on. Despite meticulous planing, the operation is a catastrophic failure, as all of the pilots fail to report in.</p><p>Alexandar Degtyarev of the Ukrainian Secret Service (USS) is sent into the zone disguised as a simple Stalker. His mission is to discover what had happened to the stingray helicopters and to see if any of the crews had survived.</p><p>The area the major first arrives in is Zaton, where there are 3 crashed helicopters:</p><p>Stingray 5, which crashed in a swamp filled with chemical anomalies in the north eastern part of Zaton.</p><p>Stingray 2, which crashed near an iron forest anomaly in the southern part of Zaton; most of the crew was killed while the chopper was still in the air. Those who survived the crash were killed by a poltergeist.</p><p>Stingray 3, which crashed in a plateau in the southern part of Zaton. In order to reach the plateau Degtyarev must consult Noah, a local Stalker, who leads him to a burnt farmstead. After investigating the 3rd Stingray, Major Degtyarev discovers the evacuation locations, he then must investigate these locations as well.</p><p>After investigating the 3 stingray choppers in Zaton, Degtyarev proceeds to Yanov area with the help of the stalker who is aptly named Pilot, where there are 2 more stingray choppers that Degtyarev needs to investigate. Stingray 4 crashed through the roof of an industrial complex, and Stingray 1 crashed on a helipad surrounded by a minefield. Once the Major finds and investigates Stingray 4, he learns of a evacuation location in Pripyat, naturally, he must go there and see if there are any survivors. Unfortunately, the only way of reaching Pripyat is through an underground tunnel, the tunnel is filled with gas, the power has been cut, and furthermore the door to the tunnel is locked, Degtayrev must ask Nitro to help him gain access. He must also gather a squad of stalkers to help him with whatever dangers lurk in the tunnels. The player may recruit up to 4 men:</p><ul><li>Zulu is a Duty fighter, he spends his days drinking vodka and shooting zombified stalkers and mutants from a tower next to Yanov station, he uses a heavy,modified machine gun.</li></ul><ul><li>Strider is the leader of the monolith squad that the player may run into in the southern part of Yanov, Strider has a burning desire to find out what happened to him and his squad, which is why he gladly accepts the players invitation to Pripyat.</li></ul><ul><li>Lieutenant Sokolov is a pilot who survived the crash of Stingray 4, he was found by a stalker named Garry who led him to the mobile lab. Once Degrayrev offers Sokolov to join him, the player must find a suit to keep Sokolov protected from the hazardous environment of the tunnel, an ecologist quest ties into this.</li></ul><ul><li>Vano, the stalker you may have already met by this point, he asks the player to help him clear his debt with a local bandit leader named Jack. Vano eagerly accepts to go to Pripyat with the player and the rest of the squad.</li></ul><p>Recruitment of all four stalkers leads to the <i>Leader</i> achievement, which will increase their chances of survival in the tunnels, though it won\'t make them invincible.</p><p>It should be noted that if any of the members die during this mission they won\'t have an ending, so the player should take extra care for their well-being, to make things worse you won\'t be able to heal them, so the player should try to prevent the team getting damaged.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1829942-xrengine_2011_07_02_10_51_49_58.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1829942" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.6"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1829942-xrengine_2011_07_02_10_51_49_58.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1829942"><img alt="The Team enters Pripyat underground" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1829942-xrengine_2011_07_02_10_51_49_58.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1829942-xrengine_2011_07_02_10_51_49_58.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1829942-xrengine_2011_07_02_10_51_49_58.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1829942-xrengine_2011_07_02_10_51_49_58.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></a><figcaption>The Team enters Pripyat underground</figcaption></figure><p>Once Nitro enables the door, the team descends down to the tunnel. What follows is a medium sized series of tunnels filled with snorks, rodents (or hamsters) and zombified stalkers. The tunnels themselves are dark and filled with small fields of anomalies at certain places, as the team makes their way through the tunnels they will be ambushed by a number of storks and rodents. When the team reaches a large oval chamber they will discover that the door leading to the next area isn\'t powered, the Major must restore power by climbing a ladder to a nearby generator, once the generator is activated the team will be ambushed by six hostile Monolith members who are equipped with high level assault rifles. After the skirmish there is another obstacle, the door still can\'t be opened, and Degtyarev will have to make his way to the control room, once a switch is activated the mentioned door will be open, but more Monolith members will come, this time they will be equipped with sniper rifles. Once the door is finally opened the player will make way through another small tunnel filled with some snorks and 10+ zombies. After clearing this part of the underground the team may finally exit the tunnels and reach Pripyat. However, the team runs into more difficulty, they are ambushed by a team of well equipped soldiers, a firefight does not take place though, as Sokolov and Degtayrev, who shows his USS legitimation, manage to convince the soldiers that they aren\'t looking for a fight. After hearing this, Zulu storms off saying that he wants nothing to do with the army or the USS.</p><p>It is possible for any and all of your squad members to die in the tunnel, preventing you from interacting with them later on.</p><p>After arriving to the Laundromat, the HQ of the military in Pripyat, Major Degtyarev meets colonel Kovalsky. Kovalsky sends him on a number of missions aimed at discovering the fate of several soldiers who were sent out on recon. Finding out what\'s jamming communications with HQ. Ambushing a Monolith squad, in order to find out if the weapons they use are the reason for Stingray malfunction.</p><p>The first mission Degtyarev will be sent out on is the ambush of the monolith squad. The major along with 3 other soldiers will have to set up an ambush in an apartment block, the three man monolith squad arrives and they are swiftly killed by Degtyarev and the soldiers. As it turns out the first squad was merely bait, with a large amount of Monolith fighters waiting in cover, it was a counter-ambush as it were.</p><p>After the player kills all the fighters and takes out the Monolith leader who is standing on a nearby rooftop, Degtyarev will search the bodies in hopes of finding the mysterious weapon. As it turns out the weapon is broken, and the way it operates can\'t be uncovered. Colonel Kovalsky asks that Degtyarev returns to the technicians he has met in his travels, and see if they know anything about the weapon.</p><p>Upon returning to Zaton and speaking to Cardan, it is revealed that Cardan worked in a secret testing facility, and that he helped design the mysterious weapon, a Gauss Rifle. Cardan gives Degtyarev his old keycard to the testing facility, after making his way to the lower levels the player will encounter a pseudogiant, a notoriously difficult to kill mutant, finally the player will arrive in the last room, where Degtyarev will discover files of a secret X8 lab, and in this room, from the looks of it, a Gauss canon can be seen. Seeing the documents will activate a new mission, Investigating lab X8, in Pripyat. Upon returning to Kovalsky, the major reassures him that its impossible that monolith, using the Gauss rifle, brought down the choppers, the Colonel will then task the Major to find the missing recon units, after a while it is discovered that it was in fact a controller that made the soldiers fight each other. Visiting lab X8 the player will have to fight through many zombies and some Monolith fighters, after which he can descended to the lower levels of the lab by activating a generator and using an elevator. There Degtyarev will find documents detailing the operations and experiments that took place in X8. Again, returning to the Laundromat the major will receive a mission in which he must destroy whatever is jamming communication abilities with HQ, as it turns out, it was an antenna, similar to antennas worshiped by Monolith. After it is destroyed major Degtyarev is put in charge of the operation by the orders of a superior via radio. Its at this point that a strange new interference shows up, the colonel and rest of the soldiers expect a monolith attack when in fact it was Strelok making his way to the Laundromat, shortly after Strelok arrives an emission starts. At this point, the reason for the failure of Operation Fairway is revealed, after an emission, all anomalies move their position, which is why the anomaly maps issued to chopper pilots were useless. The player may choose to speak with Strelok, and give Strelok the notes he found in stashes, a note to Fang, a note to Ghost and a note to Strelok, giving Strelok 3 of the notes will earn the player A Keeper of Secrets achievement, all three notes can be found in Yanov.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1830226-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_53_18_61.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1830226" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.6"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1830226-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_53_18_61.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1830226"><img alt="Major Degtyarev, Strelok and the soldiers fighting their way to the evacuation location" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830226-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_53_18_61.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1830226-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_53_18_61.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1830226-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_53_18_61.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830226-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_53_18_61.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="Major Degtyarev, Strelok and the soldiers fighting their way to the evacuation location" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830226-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_53_18_61.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1830226-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_53_18_61.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1830226-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_53_18_61.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830226-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_53_18_61.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a><figcaption>Major Degtyarev, Strelok and the soldiers fighting their way to the evacuation location</figcaption></figure><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1830221-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_38_01_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1830221" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.6"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1830221-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_38_01_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1830221"><img alt="Strelok makes his way to the Laundromat in Pripyat" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830221-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_38_01_02.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1830221-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_38_01_02.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1830221-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_38_01_02.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830221-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_38_01_02.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="Strelok makes his way to the Laundromat in Pripyat" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830221-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_38_01_02.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1830221-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_38_01_02.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1830221-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_38_01_02.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830221-xrengine_2011_07_02_19_38_01_02.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a><figcaption>Strelok makes his way to the Laundromat in Pripyat</figcaption></figure><p>Soon, a decision is made to evacuate Strelok from the zone so that he may share information and his knowledge of the zone with the military, in hopes of containing it or hopefully destroying it. The final mission involves escorting Strelok to the LZ area, while fighting off large amounts of zombies, and just before the landing zone 15+ Monolith members. After Strelok and the major reach the helicopter, the player chooses whether or not he wishes to continue playing in freeplay mode. The ending shows a slide featuring the fates of locations and people that Degtyarev came into contact with, most endings have 2 versions, which are determined by the players choices, and a few of them have are default, unchangeable endings.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Call of Pripyat puts the player in the post apocalyptic area known as the Zone. The player will have the opportunity to find better weapons,armor and artifacts, kill mutated humans and animals, and support or oppose factions of their choosing during the course of the game.</p><p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has always been known for its realistic difficulty and Call of Pripyat is no exception, with the gameplay being the most familiar element from previous games. It still forces the player to take cover, lean around corners, account for bullet drop, fire in bursts, watch the condition of their weapons and health.</p><p>At any time in the game, an emission might start. The player will receive a radio warning, and the weather will start to drastically change. Emissions are dangerous natural occurrences that take place within the zone, they are usually lethal unless the player finds shelter or uses anibiotic pills.</p><p>Equipment maintenance and improvements were introduced in Clear Sky, and they continue in Call of Pripyat. During the course of the game, the player may run into several technicians who will repair and improve their equipment for a price.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1823204-xrengine_2011_06_25_07_43_25_72.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1823204" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.6"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1823204-xrengine_2011_06_25_07_43_25_72.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1823204"><img alt="Anomalies tend to hurt a lot more in Call of Pripyat" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1823204-xrengine_2011_06_25_07_43_25_72.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1823204-xrengine_2011_06_25_07_43_25_72.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1823204-xrengine_2011_06_25_07_43_25_72.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1823204-xrengine_2011_06_25_07_43_25_72.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="Anomalies tend to hurt a lot more in Call of Pripyat" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1823204-xrengine_2011_06_25_07_43_25_72.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1823204-xrengine_2011_06_25_07_43_25_72.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1823204-xrengine_2011_06_25_07_43_25_72.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1823204-xrengine_2011_06_25_07_43_25_72.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a><figcaption>Anomalies tend to hurt a lot more in Call of Pripyat</figcaption></figure><p>Anomalies and the use of artifacts have experienced a few changes. In Shadow of Chernobyl, the player would run into artifacts and could simply pick them up, with a low to no chance of being damaged.In Call of Pripyat (like in Clear Sky) however, artifacts are invisible and they move around in anomalies, they can only become visible to the player with the use of an artifact detector.</p><p>The inventory system remains unchanged. It is grid based, which means that different items will take up different amounts of space. The player is not able to carry huge amounts of ammo or items, which places additonal importance on scavenging items to survive. Each item has its own weight, from ammo to food, and the amount that can be carried is determined by the maximum carry weight. Once it reaches its maximum the player won\'t be able to sprint for long as his stamina decreases very quickly due to the weight of his or her inventory. When the weight of items carried reaches +10 of the maximum the player won\'t be able to move at all. However, there are several ways to increase maximum carrying weight or reduce the weight of equipment.</p><p>Throughout the Zone the player will encounter mutated animals and humans, as well as Stalkers of different factions. The player will be forced to kill mutants, though he may choose whether or not he kills Stalkers. Two new types of mutants have been added to the game, the Chimera and the Burer.</p><p>Trading in Call of Pripyat is similar to past Stalker games. The player will be able to buy equipment and items from traders, and he may also sell items, though this time a weapons condition must be at a sufficient level in order to be sold.</p><p>The game also features a day/night cycle, although unlike previous Stalker games, the player will have the ability to sleep in Call of Pripyat. This is can be useful when you must go to a certain location at a certain time, such as when hunting Chimeras, which only come out at night.</p><h3>Weapons, Armor and Combat</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1831639-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_40_55_94.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1831639" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.6"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1831639-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_40_55_94.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1831639"><img alt="Shooting snorks that are attacking Zulu in Pripyat" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1831639-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_40_55_94.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1831639-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_40_55_94.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1831639-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_40_55_94.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1831639-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_40_55_94.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="Shooting snorks that are attacking Zulu in Pripyat" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1831639-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_40_55_94.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1831639-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_40_55_94.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1831639-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_40_55_94.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1831639-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_40_55_94.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a><figcaption>Shooting snorks that are attacking Zulu in Pripyat</figcaption></figure><p>Weapons and combat remain mostly unchanged; however weapons have gained several new statistics, like bullet speed or flatness. There are unfortunately no new weapons in Call of Pripyat, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the player must choose from a small number of weapons, in all there are 33 weapons along with their unique variants. Combat remains realistic and difficult; taking on three or more opponents at the same time is usually lethal. The player will have to utilize cover, and try to take out enemies as fast and as efficiently as possible, because large groups of enemies will try to flank the player. Should player be shot, or damaged by mutants, there is a good chance bleeding will occur. Depending on how much damage a player takes, bleeding can range from light to heavy, and in any case it should be tended to with bandages as quickly as possible. Aiming down a weapon will bring up that weapon\'s iron sights, or scopes if they are attached to the weapon. Apart from scopes, grenade launchers can also be attached to weapons. However, finding ammo for grenade launchers is quite difficult. In order to attach scopes or grenade launchers to a weapon, an improvement must be installed. The improvements for weapons and armor have three tiers, for which 3 tool sets must be acquired and given to a technician. These improvements allow the player to take a relatively weak weapon that can be found early in the game and make it stronger. This obviously works even better for naturally powerful weapons, but as the power of a weapon increases so do the costs of installing improvements. Armor also remains very similar to previous games, though the amount of armor pieces is perhaps lessened. The easiest, though most expansive way, to acquire armor would be visiting Nimble in Skadovsk, where the exoskeleton suit can cost up to 60,000 rubles. Apart from that, armor can be found on the corpses of a few dead Stalkers, as well as received for completing missions.</p><p>In Shadow of Chernobyl, the player was able to use five artifacts regardless of the armor or suit they wore. In Call of Pripyat, the amount of artifacts that can be used varies and is dependent on the suit. Some suits allow no artifacts to be used where as others, with some improvements, can use up to five artifacts. Like previous Stalker games, weapons and armor in Call of Pripyat have a condition statistic. The more armor gets damaged, and the more the player uses their gun, the more their condition will deteriorate. Armor\'s condition also worsens when the player is walking through a particularly dangerous gas or flaming anomaly, because the toxicity and heat of the anomaly will effect the armor.</p><h3>Technicians, Improvements and Repairs</h3><p>Improvements and repairs first appeared in Clear Sky, and they are also a part of Call of Pripyat.</p><p>The improvements vary depending on the tools the technician uses, some improvements increase reliability, some improve handling, others accuracy, some the magazine size, and yet others decrease the weight of a weapon, bullet speed, flatness and recoil, all of these statistics of a weapon can be improved, as well as adding a place where a scope or grenade launcher may be attached to, it should be noted that improvements have no negative sides, only positive.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1823287-cardan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1823287" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.6"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1823287-cardan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1823287"><img alt="Improvement and Repair screen" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1823287-cardan.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1823287-cardan.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1823287-cardan.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1823287-cardan.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="Improvement and Repair screen" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1823287-cardan.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1823287-cardan.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1823287-cardan.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1823287-cardan.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a><figcaption>Improvement and Repair screen</figcaption></figure><p>There are 2 technicians in the game, Nitro and Cardan. Cardan is located in Skadovsk, he is fond of vodka and will require a bottle for the simple improvements and two bottles for the more advance improvements, Nitro is located in Yanov station. Each type of weapon and armor have their own unique improvements. There are 3 tiers of improvements and each tier usually has up to 4 or 5 improvements, sometimes a tier will feature two improvements in the same line, choosing one eliminates the other, obviously as the weapons power and improvements level increases so does the price of installing them, the quality of the item, as well as its condition also plays a role in determining the price of repair. Tool sets are used for installing improvements, and both technicians will ask you to bring them 3 sets of tools, they can be found around the zone, there are two tool sets in each area, there are 3 types of tools, so in all the player will be able to find 6 tools.</p><p>Zaton: 1 set of tools for simple work, 1 set of tools for fine work.</p><p>Yanov: 1 set of tools for simple work, 1 set of tools for fine work.</p><p>Pripyat: 2 sets of calibration tools.</p><p>Once the player brings all three types of tools to one or both technicians the player will earn an achievement depending on what technician the player gave the tools to.

Unlike Shadow of Chernobyl, artifacts won\u2019t be visible, they will move around anomalies hidden from the players sight unless the player uses a detector, making the acquisition of artifacts much more difficult. Anomalies are found perhaps lest often, though every anomaly is unique. They range from chemical, gravitational, fire, electrical, to gas anomalies and many others. Anomalies can be far more dangerous in Call of Pripyat then they were in Shadow of Chernobyl, the damage of all anomalies is increased and it\u2019s advised that the player takes at least some form of protection against the damage an anomaly will dish out. Each area of the game will have its own anomalies, they will be shown on the map surrounded by white circles, each anomaly will drop certain artifacts, after taking the artifacts, anomalies will re-spawn them after a quest is complete. The exact location of artifacts can be pinpointed by using a detector, there are four detectors in all, each one more powerful than the other.</p><p><u>Echo Detector</u></p><p>This is the detector that the major has with him when he arrives, it is the simplest and least powerful of all four detectors, it locates artifacts simply by beeping, it gives no other indicator as to how close the player is to an artifact.</p><p><u>Bear Detector</u></p><p>The second detector is rather common in the zone, it can be dropped by more experienced stalkers and in addition to beeping it points the player in the location of the artifacts, often, it can be purchased from Owl.</p><p><u>Veles Detector</u></p><p>The third detector, along with beeping this detector shows the player a field, in it artifacts will appear as dots, this type of detector is rather rare, and can be found in a handful of places, only dropped by very experienced stalkers, it can be bought from the ecologists, and rarely bought from Owl. The player must find three veles detectors in the quest <i>Tempting Business</i> after which the player will receive a Svarog detector.</p><p><u>Svarog Detector</u></p><p>The most powerful of all detectors, it is a prototype, and the player may only gain it once, at the end of the quest <i>Tempting Business</i>. It shows a field very much like Veles, but unlike it, Svarog also shows anomalies as well as artifacts, making artifact runs a breeze.</p><p>It can also be noted that Svarog is the name of the Slavic God of blacksmithing and fire.</p><h3>Emissions</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1830086-emission.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1830086" data-size="small" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.30800323362975"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:30.8%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1830086-emission.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1830086"><img alt="Left, an emission just starting.

During an emission, everything runs for shelter. Emissions happen regularly, on average about once a day, and the only way to survive an emission is to find shelter (the PDA shows the location of the nearest shelter) or to take anabiotic pills which are rare. Emissions last about 5 minutes with the peak lasting 10-20 seconds, at this point lightning, and "blackouts" will be at their worst, while the camera will shake uncontrollably, if the player fails to take the pills or find shelter at this point Major Degtyarev will die.

Unlike previous games however, Call of Pripyat introduces a storage space, which is located in each \u201csafe spot\u201d, there the player may store as many items and as much ammunition as he or she desires. Other than that the player may simply leave any undesired loot on the ground, the loot will stay there as long as the game lasts. Maximum carrying weight has received some improvements since Shadow of Chernobyl, the ability to reduce the weight of weapons and armor you plan to use is very helpful, apart from that the player may use the \u201cHercules\u201d consumable item which adds 20 kilograms to the maximum carry weight, there are also artifacts that increase the carry weight maximum, allowing the player to reach a rather high carry weight and therefore allowing the player to carry many items and much more ammo.</p><h3>Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1831646-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_54_44_77.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1831646" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.6"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1831646-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_54_44_77.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1831646"><img alt="Map" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1831646-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_54_44_77.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1831646-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_54_44_77.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1831646-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_54_44_77.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1831646-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_54_44_77.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="Map" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1831646-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_54_44_77.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1831646-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_54_44_77.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1831646-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_54_44_77.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1831646-xrengine_2011_07_04_15_54_44_77.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a><figcaption>Map</figcaption></figure><p>The personal digital assistant, or PDA, is an electronic device, where many stalkers keep personal info, information about stashes or their objectives.

Icons will show on the map detailing the location of the next objective in the mission, they will be shown as yellow circles, the player may use the mission log to gain more information about their current tasks and locate the mission location on the map. Another accessible screen is the stats screen, where the player may look at several statistics, including: Days spent in the zone, mutants and stalkers killed, their most used weapon, the most powerful mutant killed by the player, earned achievements etc. And the third and final screen is the message log screen, where the player may look over conversations that major Degtyarev had with NPCs and information that pops up like the starting of an emission, gaining the knowledge of the location of a stash and mission rewards.

Thought the game the player may see many numbers of abandoned apartment complexes, tunnels, industrial buildings, derelict ships and trains and other objects. As for the environment the areas around Pripyat feature a lot of swamps while Pripyat itself is a ghost city, filled with abandoned commercial and residential buildings.</p><p>The atmosphere of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat is, like the previous games, excellent, the Stalker series has always received good reception from both critics and players for its atmosphere and Call of Pripyat is no exception. This game features a very dark, post-apocalyptic, horror survival atmosphere. Stalkers as well as members of other factions will die from mutant attacks, emissions or the player\'s gun, showing just how lethal the zone is. Zone itself is filled with anomalies,radiation and other harmful environments further increasing the zone\'s lethality. Players may explore dark tunnels, factories and apartment buildings with their light or night vision on, all the while listening to background noises, making it a chilling experience.</p><h2>Areas and locations</h2><p>There are 3 areas in Call of Pripyat, Zaton, Yanov (or Jupiter in some translations) and Pripyat. The areas and locations vary depending on the environment they are situated in. Each location has a "safe spot" Zaton has Skadovsk, Yanov has Yanov Station and Pripyat has the Laundromat and like in previous games the player must holster his weapon before he is granted accesses to these locations. Each area has different anomalies as well, some more and others less dangerous.</p><h3><u>Zaton Area</u></h3><p>The first accessible area is Zaton, it\'s located in a primarily swampy environment that has a few industrial buildings such as closed down factories and a sawmill. Around Zaton the player can see derelict ships, some of them dating even before the Chernobyl incident, it is probable that the area was once filled with water, but now, possibly due to radiation, water levels are very low. There is a safe area, a bar situated in a ship called Skadovsk, named after the ship, its one of the few safe locations in Zaton.</p><p><b>Skadovsk</b></p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1823283-skadovsk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1823283" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.6"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1823283-skadovsk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1823283"><img alt="Skadovsk" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1823283-skadovsk.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1823283-skadovsk.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1823283-skadovsk.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1823283-skadovsk.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="Skadovsk" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1823283-skadovsk.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1823283-skadovsk.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1823283-skadovsk.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1823283-skadovsk.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a><figcaption>Skadovsk</figcaption></figure><p>Skadovsk is a bar and safe location set in a rusted, derelict ship, established by Beard and Grouse, this is one of the few places in Zaton where stalkers can come in, have a drink and relax without the worry of mutant attacks. The ship is divided into 3 decks. Beard and Sultan as well as most stalkers are located on the lowest deck, Cardan and Owl are in the second and Nimble is on the third deck.</p><p>There are several people who offer the player services, Beard offers food and drink, he\'ll also buy artifacts for rather high prices, Owl sells information,ammo,weapons,armor, headgear,detectors and other items. Tremor, a medic, will heal your wounds an tend to your radiation (for a time at least), Nimble a rare and/or unique weapons and armor dealer, whose prices are very high, Sultan a local crime boss who offers the player several jobs, and Cardan a local technician who is a bit too fond of vodka.</p><p>Beard came to the center of the zone with his long time friend Grouse to open a bar of sorts in order to help stalkers on their way to the center of the zone. Beard is seen as a good, kind-hearted person by stalkers, he is at odds with Sultan the local crime boss, and Owl, the local trader. He sells food and drinks, he also buys artifacts, the artifacts he will buy vary from time to time, he will offer to buy up to three pieces at any given time, once you sell him the artifacts a new list will take place, selling artifacts to beard is one of the fastest ways to earn large amounts of money.</p><p>Owl is a trader that offers the player many services, buying and selling information as well as selling items, like weapons, ammo , armor and other items. From time to time he will also have a job for you. He is unscrupulous and rarely does something disinterestedly.</p><p>Sultan is the local crime boss and leader of the bandits. Before he came to the zone he had a best friend from high school, Tolyan. His friend got into drugs, some pot at first and later the "heavy stuff", he scored some bad drugs one day and that was that. Sultan then killed the drug dealer and after spending some time in prison he got out and opened a business, after his business failed for unknown reasons he set his sights on the Zone. In six months he advanced to the position of leader of the bandits, and since then he has made alliances with old enemies and has made new friends.</p><p>Skadovsk also has a technician, Cardan, who had two friends, Joker and Barge that came to the zone with him. After a heated argument they all went their separate ways, and Cardan has regretted that day ever since. Its this regret that made him sink into a serious case of alcoholism. Cardan will repair and improve the players gear, so long as he has the tools and two bottles of vodka.</p><p>There is another trader in Skadovsk alongside Owl, Nimble a trader who was seen in previous Stalker games, he offers high tech guns and armor to the player for rather large sums of money. He used to work for Lebedev during events in Shadow of Chernobyl as a runner, but he claims that he made up his own list of contacts, and now offers Stalkers advance weaponry and armor for a steep price of course. The prices range from 4.000 rubles to several tens of thousands of rubles, the player must make a down payment that is one fifth of the items full price as well as paying the full price of the item on delivery.</p><p>Nimble offers:</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1830123-xrengine_2011_07_02_18_41_49_45.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1830123" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.6"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1830123-xrengine_2011_07_02_18_41_49_45.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1830123"><img alt="Nimble" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830123-xrengine_2011_07_02_18_41_49_45.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1830123-xrengine_2011_07_02_18_41_49_45.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1830123-xrengine_2011_07_02_18_41_49_45.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830123-xrengine_2011_07_02_18_41_49_45.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="Nimble" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830123-xrengine_2011_07_02_18_41_49_45.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1830123-xrengine_2011_07_02_18_41_49_45.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1830123-xrengine_2011_07_02_18_41_49_45.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830123-xrengine_2011_07_02_18_41_49_45.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nimble</figcaption></figure><p>Pistols - 700 rubles, advance payment, plus 2.800 rubles on delivery, 3.500 rubles total.</p><p>Close Range Weapons - 2.000 rubles, advance payment, plus 8.000 rubles on delivery, 10.000 total.</p><p>Assault Weapons - 4.000 rubles, advance payment, plus 16.000 rubles on delivery, 20.000 total.</p><p>Sniper Weapons - 4.000 rubles, advance payment, plus 16.000 rubles on delivery, 20.000 total.</p><p>Armored Suits - 8.000 rubles, advance payment, plus 32.000 rubles on delivery, 40.000 total.</p><p>Exoskeletons - 12.000 rubles advance payment, plus 48.000 rubles on delivery, 60.000 total.</p><p>Other notable Zaton locations:</p><p><b>Sawmill</b></p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1830002-xrengine_2011_07_02_15_25_02_83.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1830002" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.6"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1830002-xrengine_2011_07_02_15_25_02_83.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1830002"><img alt="Sawmill" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830002-xrengine_2011_07_02_15_25_02_83.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1830002-xrengine_2011_07_02_15_25_02_83.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1830002-xrengine_2011_07_02_15_25_02_83.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830002-xrengine_2011_07_02_15_25_02_83.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="Sawmill" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830002-xrengine_2011_07_02_15_25_02_83.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1830002-xrengine_2011_07_02_15_25_02_83.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1830002-xrengine_2011_07_02_15_25_02_83.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1830002-xrengine_2011_07_02_15_25_02_83.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sawmill</figcaption></figure><p>Is the location of an old sawmill in the eastern part of Zaton, its overrun with zombies and inside the attic of a building there, the player can find a toolset for basic work, which can be turned over to Cardan, or Nitro for some cash, and the ability to install simple, first tier modifications on a weapon.

Now it serves as a lair to a pack of bloodsuckers. With the help of the local hunter and "sheriff" Grouse, Major Degtyarev manages to infiltrate the lair, only to find a large number of bloodsuckers sleeping in the building. Major Degtyarev and Grouse sneak out, and the next logical step is to gas the entire building in hopes of killing off the bloodsuckers. After the building has been gassed the player may once again enter it and visit the "sleeping chamber" of the bloodsuckers, they will all be dead. Oddly, the player may find the valuable and rare ammo for the extremely powerful Gauss rifle in this building.</p><h3><u>Yanov Area</u></h3><p>Yanov (or Jupiter) is the next area accessible to the player. There, Major Degtyarev will have to investigate 2 more helicopters, after searching one of them, he will discover an evacuation zone set in Pripyat, where he will have to go next. Yanov Train Station is the hub of activity in this area, in Yanov Stations, stalkers may find a place to rest, have a drink or a meal as well as a medic and technician who will tend to their equipment. Yanov is an area with several swamps, other than that, it has many trains in unusable condition and many train tunnels, in this area there is also an ecologists lab, and an industrial complex.</p><p><b>Yanov Train Station</b></p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1829617-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_16_43_99.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1829617" data-size="small" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.6"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1829617-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_16_43_99.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1829617"><img alt="Yanov Station" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/122249/1829617-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_16_43_99.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1829617-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_16_43_99.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1829617-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_16_43_99.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1829617-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_16_43_99.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/122249/1829617-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_16_43_99.jpg 320w"><noscript><img alt="Yanov Station" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/122249/1829617-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_16_43_99.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1829617-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_16_43_99.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1829617-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_16_43_99.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1829617-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_16_43_99.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/122249/1829617-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_16_43_99.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" data-width="320"></noscript></a><figcaption>Yanov Station</figcaption></figure><p>Yanov Train Station, like Skadovsk before it, is the safe location in Yanov. Located here are traders, medics and a technician, as well as the leaders of Duty and Freedom and many quest givers. Yanov Station has a small basement where stalkers may sleep and where the player may store his items. The main area, where most stalkers can be found, is where tickets used to be purchased, now Hawaiian runs his shop from the ticket booth, apart from the large room in the middle, Yanov station is divided by rooms to the west and east, where in one part, Freedom leader Loki, and the medic take residence and in the opposite part Nitro, the technician and Lieutenant Colonel Shulga leader of Duty are located.</p><p>Nitro is the technician in Yanov, he will give the player various missions, and he himself will be involved in a number of tasks, <i>The Road to Pripyat</i> and <i>Stingray 1</i> amongst others. He will ask of the player to find him old radio parts in the cement factory, as well as tools needed for more advanced weapon and armor improvements, unlike Cardan, Nitro has no addictions to speak of. He is a computer and weapons expert and is also a Duty sympathizer, he will lower his prices to any friends of Duty.</p><p>Bonesetter is the resident medic of the station, he is involved in the quest <i>Theft</i> and offers the player medical supplies, and healing of physical wounds as well as radiation. Due to Freedom and Duty being based in Yanov, most people choose sides, but Bonesetter is firmly neutral, advising all stalkers to steer clear of Duty\'s and Freedom\'s war, should the player achieve the <i>Balance Advocate</i> achievement, Bonesetter will offer items at a very low price.</p><p>Hawaiian is the local trader, he offers a variety of items, including armor,weapons,ammo,drinks,food,detectors and other items. As the player progresses through the game, the quality, and price of Hawaiian\'s items will increase. He is a firm Freedom supporter, and should the player align himself with Duty, Hawaiian\'s prices will go up, and he will buy items from the player at a very low price.</p><p>Loki and Lieutenant Colonel Shulga are the leaders of Freedom and Duty, respectively. They will offer the player missions, and information on either faction, their founding, purpose and organization. Supporting either will earn the player <i>A Friend of Duty</i> or <i>A Friend of Freedom</i> achievements, both achievements can\'t be acquired in the same playthrough. Should the player choose to support neither group, he/she will earn the <i>Balance Advocate</i> achievement.</p><p>Other than the mentioned NPCs, there are several more who will offer missions, Trapper being the most notable.</p><p>Trapper is an aging hunter who has acquired quite a bit of experience in hunting mutants. He will offer the player advice on hunting the most dangerous mutants, and will give the player 3 missions, in which the player must hunt down several bloodsuckers, burers, and a chimera. The chimera in question is the same chimera that killed Trapper\'s oldest and best friend Fox, Trapper didn\'t even pull out his gun before the chimera attacked, this led him to the realization that he has grown old, and leaves his hunting days in order to teach younger stalkers. Should the player avenge Fox by killing the chimera, Trapper will give the player his prized weapon, the unique variant of a Chaser 13 shotgun, named Predator.</p><p>Other notable Yanov locations:</p><p><b>Mobile Lab</b></p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1829947-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_48_24_88.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1829947" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.6"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1829947-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_48_24_88.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1829947"><img alt="Mobile Lab" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1829947-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_48_24_88.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1829947-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_48_24_88.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1829947-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_48_24_88.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1829947-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_48_24_88.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="Mobile Lab" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1829947-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_48_24_88.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1829947-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_48_24_88.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1829947-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_48_24_88.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1829947-xrengine_2011_06_25_20_48_24_88.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mobile Lab</figcaption></figure><p>Here the 3 ecologist scientists are present, professor Hermann, professor Ozersky and the technician Grey, who will at first only repair equipment, but later on he will install improvements on armor and helmets, but not weapons.

It is a ghost city, the only inhabitants (apart from mutants) are the military personal that survived the Stingray crashes and Monolith members. There are no secondary missions in Pripyat, so the time it will take the player to complete this area is shorter than in Zaton or Yanov. Pripyat is the first area in the game where the army has an organized presence, but due to low manpower and resources they are weakening by the minute. Monolith is no longer the threat it once was, though they are still not to be trifled with as they are well equipped, monolith has more numbers than the military in Pripyat and most importantly they are fanatical.</p><p><b>Laundromat</b></p><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1831089-xrengine_2011_07_03_13_59_09_94.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1831089" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="0.6"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:60.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1831089-xrengine_2011_07_03_13_59_09_94.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1831089"><img alt="The Laundromat" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1831089-xrengine_2011_07_03_13_59_09_94.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1831089-xrengine_2011_07_03_13_59_09_94.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1831089-xrengine_2011_07_03_13_59_09_94.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1831089-xrengine_2011_07_03_13_59_09_94.jpg 480w"><noscript><img alt="The Laundromat" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1831089-xrengine_2011_07_03_13_59_09_94.jpg" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1831089-xrengine_2011_07_03_13_59_09_94.jpg 1280w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/122249/1831089-xrengine_2011_07_03_13_59_09_94.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/122249/1831089-xrengine_2011_07_03_13_59_09_94.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Laundromat</figcaption></figure><p>Like Yanov Station, and Skadovsk before it, Pripyat Laundromate is a safe zone where the player can seek medical assistance,sleep and store his items among other things.

Since no trading takes place in the laundromat, the player can only receive military rations in the form of ammunition and medical supplies, again, there is an area where Degtyarev can sleep and store his items. The upside is that the medic and technician will preform their duties for free (The technician will only preform repairs).

They are a collective of Stalkers who have no agenda other than to explore the zone, and survive by selling artifacts or weapons and armor they find. They are at a war with bandits, who try to extort them or outright kill them. Loners are based in Skadovsk and are led by Beard. In Call of Pripyat they are more organized and somewhat more "unified" though not in the true sense of the word.</p><p>In-game there is the <i>One of Ours</i> achievement, it involves helping loners out whenever the player can do so. From hunting mutants to paying off a debt to rescuing a captured stalker. When this achievement is earned Beard will gladly give the player full prices for artifacts, and loners will become allies, though the trader Owl will increase his prices.</p><h3>Ukrainian Military</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1831088-shoc_military.png" data-ref-id="1300-1831088" data-size="small" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1831088-shoc_military.png" data-ref-id="1300-1831088"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" data-width="256" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1831088-shoc_military.png" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1831088-shoc_military.png 256w"><noscript><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1831088-shoc_military.png" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1831088-shoc_military.png 256w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" data-width="256"></noscript></a></figure><p>The only military member that can be seen, prior to Pripyat, is lieutenant Sokolov, the surviving pilot of the crashed Stingray 4. The hub of military activity in Call of Pripyat is Pripyat itself, military survivors made an outpost of sorts in the Laundromat. However, the military is nowhere nearly as present as they were in previous games. In Pripyat they have low manpower, their resources and morale is dwindling and they have no communication with HQ. Nonetheless the military plays a pivotal role in Call of Pripyat. They are in a constant war with the Monolith faction, though it may be more accurate to say its the other way around. From the start of their arrival to Pripyat, many soldiers were lost, some killed by mutants others killed off by Monolith. Like in previous Stalker games, the military is shoot first ask questions later type of faction, a squad of soldiers almost opened fire on major Degtyarev on his arrival to Pripyat. The military suffers heavy loses, as soldiers are unfamiliar and inexperienced with the zone.</p><h3>Monolith</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1829560-monolith_patch.png" data-ref-id="1300-1829560" data-size="small" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1829560-monolith_patch.png" data-ref-id="1300-1829560"><img alt="Monolith (\u041c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442)" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" data-width="256" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1829560-monolith_patch.png" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1829560-monolith_patch.png 256w"><noscript><img alt="Monolith (\u041c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442)" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1829560-monolith_patch.png" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1829560-monolith_patch.png 256w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" data-width="256"></noscript></a><figcaption>Monolith (\u041c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442)</figcaption></figure><p>The Monolith faction plays a minor role in Call of Pripyat, they have lost both power and men when compared to their position in previous games. Some of the members of Monolith are still openly hostile to any and all stalkers, and there are some who have lost their memory, and remember very little of their recent lives, due to the destruction of C-Consciousness. This appears to be the case with a small Monolith squad that the player can find in Yanov. The squad leader, Strider, says he can\'t remember anything in the past 7 years and that its very much the same with the rest of his squad, Strider then asks of the player to see how Stalkers in Yanov Station feel about Monolith, he is worried, seeing as how every Monolith member opened fire on any stalker in the past. The player will then have a choice in leading Duty or Freedom members to the Monolith location, after which the members of the squad will join either Duty or Freedom. However, not all Monolith members are so peaceful, many remain openly hostile to anyone but other Monoliths, they are fanatical fighters who fight to the death, Colonel Kovalsky in Pripyat explains that they once captured a monolith fighter who got stunned by a grenade, and when they weren\'t looking, the fighter hit his head on the wall, so hard, that his skull cracked like an egg. But Monolith isn\'t as powerful in Call of Pripyat as they were in previous games. Due to Stalkers and other factions breaking into the center of the zone, Monolith doesn\'t have the numbers or power it once had.</p><h3>Ecologists</h3><figure data-align="left" data-img-src="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1829569-ekolog_patch.png" data-ref-id="1300-1829569" data-size="small" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:100.0%" href="https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122249/1829569-ekolog_patch.png" data-ref-id="1300-1829569"><img alt="Ecologists (\u0415\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433)" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" data-width="256" class="js-lazy-load-image" data-src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1829569-ekolog_patch.png" data-srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1829569-ekolog_patch.png 256w"><noscript><img alt="Ecologists (\u0415\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433)" src="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1829569-ekolog_patch.png" srcset="https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/122249/1829569-ekolog_patch.png 256w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" data-width="256"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ecologists (\u0415\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433)</figcaption></figure><p>Ecologists have the same role they\'ve had in previous games, collecting scientific material and studying the zone.

Grey (or Novikov) a former member of Clear Sky, he remains in his role of a technician. During the course of the game the scientists at the lab will have a number of tasks for you, from scanning anomalies to recovering artifacts. The lab is protected by mercenaries and free stalkers, later on professor Hermann will ask for your assistance in locating more guards, going to either Freedom or Duty will secure the needed manpower.

In previous games they acted in their own self interest, this time however, they seem to be working for a single, unrevealed employer, who wishes information on several buildings in Zaton, as well as the mobile lab in Yanov, and the mysterious location Oasis.</p><p>There are fewer mercenaries in Call of Pripyat, and they aren\'t as hostile or aggressive anymore, but they will gladly open fire after giving a few warnings. Being financed by an apparently very wealthy individual means that there will be fewer mercenaries but they will be very well equipped, and fighting them will be very difficult for the player early in the game. Owl, the trader in Skadovsk is interested in the activities of a mercenary squad in an industrial building, Owl will pay Degtyarev to sneak in and steal any info he can, while not harming any of the mercenaries. A group of mercenaries are also located at the Substation Workshops, the player may gain access only after the mission</p><p><i>Take the food to the mercenaries</i> where Degtyarev must give the mercs 6 rations of any type of food.

Unlike the previous STALKER games, Call of Pripyat\'s gameplay mechanics and engine is a lot more refined. Therefore the game is pretty much in no \u201cneed\u201d of modding, so the designers will be forced to change and innovate on the game instead of just improving.</p><p>There is no official release information at the moment, and there is neither any other info what the mod will include other than that the mod will be called \u201cCall of Pripyat Complete\u201d. You can most likely expect to see pretty much the same changes you\'ve seen with the previous Complete mods, only at a higher level: enhanced graphics, redone textures, new and improved sounds and so forth.

      deck: "A prequel to the open-world first-person shooter S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. Set a year before the events of the first game, Clear Sky follows a new character, Scar, through the Zone.",
      description:
        '<h2>Overview</h2><p>Clear Sky is the prequel to S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl, a near-future FPS taking place in a place called the Zone in the Ukraine. A second accident had occurred at Chernobyl, but instead of irradiating the land, it altered the laws of physics and reality itself within the region around it, creating deadly anomalies and bizarre artifacts that have become modern day treasures to those lucky enough to find one. SoC followed the adventures of a stalker as he headed into the previously unreachable heart of the Zone centered on Chernobyl itself, there to discover a dark secret that would change the world.</p><p>The Zone is normally off limits to everyone and military checkpoints try to keep people out, but adventurers called S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s have managed to get in to risk their lives for that one discovery that could make them rich. Several factions live within the Zone and the military is more concerned about keeping people out than in dealing with the ones that are already there leaving most of them to pursue their own agendas whether it be protecting each other from the dangers there or enforcing the law in making sure that no one disturbs the status quo.</p><p>The sequel takes place in 2012, a year before the events of the first game and follows the same FPS formula in a new storyline.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The story involves a mercenary named Scar who succumbs to one of the random blowouts that sweep the region from Chernobyl. A blowout is a storm of radiation and energy that everyone is forced to take cover from if they want to live, but somehow, Scar survives exposure in the open while leading a group of scientists into the Zone. He is found and rescued by a group calling itself "Clear Sky" who are interested in studying the Zone and Chernobyl in order to understand their mysteries in the hopes that they might help mankind. They make it clear that Scar\'s resistant nature to a blowout isn\'t a permanent effect and that if he or Clear Sky do not find out why they are occurring far more frequently and stop it, Scar will eventually die.</p><p>After following several leads and exploring the Zone, Scar manages to make his way to Chernobyl where he is asked to stop the leading character from the first game from reaching the reactor. The ending ties into the events at the start of the first game.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game takes place in the Zone which is divided into several areas comprised of modern day, Soviet-styled, ruins, landmarks, and open areas of dead trees and blasted ground. Most of the areas are open to exploration right from the start while others will be made accessible depending on how far the player has gotten in their quest. The open-ended approach that it takes with its FPS formula is also enforced by the ability to take "jobs" from other stalkers and earn money which can be used to purchase items such as valuable ammunition to upgrades for both weapons and armor. The player can ignore the main quest and pursue their own adventures in the Zone before returning to it. There is no time limit placed on their activities.</p><p>Clear Sky also shares SoC\'s use of real-world weapons. Players can also bleed to death or die from being shot only a few times as opposed to other FPSs that are far more lenient with regenerating health systems. Weapons and armor can also wear down from use and damage requiring the player to find technicians that can keep their equipment in working order. The sci-fi setting also lends itself to the use of artifacts, strange items formed within the anomalous and often deadly disturbances that litter the landscape thanks to the warping effects of Chernobyl\'s accident.</p><p>The largest change from the previous title is in the expansion of factions within the game. Players can join most of the factions within the game after performing several jobs to prove their abilities and change their attitudes towards them which is tracked by the in-game PDA. Conversely, attacking members of a faction will slide their responses in the opposite direction. Factions won\'t often go to war with each other, but unlike in the previous game, it is possible to see faction headquarters defend themselves more often from roaming bandits. The player can also change the political landscape of a particular area by wiping out or aiding certain factions. A checkpoint that may be run by the Duty faction may be run by the Freedom faction the next day if the player decided to wipe out the previous inhabitants.</p><h2>Factions</h2><p>With the introduction of Faction Wars into Clear Sky, both old and new factions fight over territory and resources in the Zone.</p><h4>Military</h4><p>The Ukrainian Military, hostile to everyone in the Zone.</p><h4>Clear Sky</h4><p>Scientists trying to learn more about the Zone.</p><h4>Renegades</h4><p>Bandits fighting against Clear Sky.</p><h4>Stalkers</h4><p>People trying to make a living and survive in the Zone</p><h4>Bandits</h4><p>Thieves and criminals who steal and kill to get what they want.</p><h4>Duty</h4><p>A semi-militaristic faction, trying to help stalkers and want to stop the Zone from expanding. Hostile against Freedom.</p><h4>Freedom</h4><p>Anarchists who want the zone to be available for everyone. Hostile against Duty.</p><h4>Mercenaries</h4><p>Mercs who will do almost any job for the right price.</p><h4>Monolith</h4><p>A religious faction who worship the "monolith" in the Chernobyl Power Plant. Hostile towards anyone trying to get to the center of the Zone.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Pistols</h3><ul><li>PMm</li><li>Martha</li><li>Fort- 12</li><li>Kora -919</li><li>Walker P9m</li></ul><h3>Shotguns</h3><ul><li>Chaser 13</li><li>Sawed-off shotgun</li><li>TOZ 34</li><li>SPSA14</li></ul><h3>Assault rifles</h3><ul><li>FT 200M</li><li>GP 37</li><li>IL 86</li><li>Akm 74/2</li><li>Akm 74/u</li><li>Obokan</li><li>Thunder S14</li></ul><h3>Sniper Rifles</h3><ul><li>SVDm 2</li><li>Vintar BC</li><li>SVUmk2</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Explosives</h3><ul><li>Bulldog 6 grenade launcher</li><li>RPG-7</li><li>RGD-5 grenade</li><li>F1 grenade</li></ul><p> </p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>Multiplayer offers the basic gametypes of Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. Players are divided into two teams: Freedom and the Mercenaries. The Freedom team uses ex-USSR weapons while the Mercenaries utilize NATO firearms to realize their objectives. Players can earn money during the match in order to purchase new weapons, ammunition, and armor similar to Counterstrike.</p><p>The other game types that are offered is Capture the Artifact which is a slightly different variant of Capture the Flag, only now with artifacts protected by both factions and must be retrieved by either team and returned to base for a score. Artifact Hunt places an artifact somewhere on the map that both teams must fight over and carry back to their base. An additional twist in both artifact game types is that the artifact can be set to generate a deadly anomaly preventing anyone from picking it up for a time.</p><p> </p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>The <a href="/original-soundtrack/3015-189/" data-ref-id="3015-189"> original score</a> for S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Clear Sky was composed by MoozE.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Track No.</th><th>Song Title</th><th>Running Time</th></tr><tr><td>01</td><td><b> Swamps of Despair<br /></b></td><td>04.19</td></tr><tr><td>02</td><td><b> Theme of Escape<br /></b></td><td>08.34</td></tr><tr><td>03</td><td><b> Shadows</b></td><td>04.40</td></tr><tr><td>04</td><td><b> Theme of Gargabe<br /></b></td><td>05.01</td></tr><tr><td>05</td><td><b> Radwind, pt.1<br /></b></td><td>03.16</td></tr><tr><td>06</td><td><b> Fog</b></td><td>03.05</td></tr><tr><td>07</td><td><b> S.A.D.</b></td><td>04.35</td></tr><tr><td>08</td><td><b> Theme of Red Forest<br /></b></td><td>05.31</td></tr><tr><td>09</td><td><b> Ghost City<br /></b></td><td>04.42</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><b> Radwind, pt.2<br /></b></td><td>02.16</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><b> Hospital</b></td><td>04.22</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td><b> Sleeping In Ashes v.2<br /></b></td><td>04.46</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimal</h3><p> </p><ul><li>Microsoft Windows XP(Service Pack 2)/Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4</li><li>Intel Pentium 4 2.0 Ghz / AMD XP 2200</li><li>512 MB RAM</li><li>10 GB free hard disc space</li><li>128 MB DirectX 8.0 compatible card / nVIDIA GeForce\u2122 5700 / ATI Radeon 9600</li><li>DirectX 9.0 compatible sound card</li><li>LAN/Internet/Cable/DSL for Internet games</li><li>Keyboard, Mouse</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Recommended</h3><p> </p><ul><li>Microsoft Windows XP/Vista (SP1)</li><li>Intel Core 2 Duo E6400 / AMD 64 X2 4200</li><li>2 GB RAM</li><li>10 GB free hard disc space</li><li>256 MB DirectX 9.0c compatible card* / nVIDIA GeForce\u2122 8800 GT / ATI Radeon HD 2900 XT</li><li>DirectX 9.0 compatible sound card</li><li>LAN/Internet/Cable/DSL for Internet games</li><li>Keyboard, Mouse</li></ul><p>* for the DirectX 10 effects Windows Vista and DirectX 10 compatible video card are required</p>',
